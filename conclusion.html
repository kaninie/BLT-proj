                        <h2>Tick Abundance and Trends</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p class="mb-0">The highest tick populations were found at Rouge Park, Rouge Park: Glen Eagle Vista Trail and Colonel Danforth Trail, while the lowest populations were found at High Park, Cedar Ridge Park and Toronto Hunt Club. Further studies should be done to determine if there are any factors (both abiotic and biotic) in each park location that may be contributing to higher tick populations.</p>&nbsp;
                        <!--<h2>Trend of tick abundance</h2>-->
                        <p class="mb-0">Between 2014 and 2017, the total number of ticks observed increased. This number then decreased between 2017 and 2019 and between 2019 and 2022 no ticks were found. One limitation of this study is that not all park locations were dragged every spring or fall, depending on the previous season's results.</p>&nbsp;
                        <p class="mb-0">The majority of ticks found were adults or nymphs, while only a small percentage were larvae. Adult ticks are about the size of an apple seed, nymphs are about the size of a poppy seed, and larvae are the size of a grain of sand. Since tick larvae are so small, this might have had an impact on the number of them recovered during the course of the study. In addition, the type of cloth used may have resulted in a recovery of more adults or nymphs.</p>&nbsp;
                        
                        <!--<h2>Ticks carrying <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em></h2>-->
                        <p class="mb-0">Only 35.9% of the ticks observed were positive for the bacteria <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> and the highest number of ticks positive for this bacteria was observed in Rouge Park in 2017. Since blacklegged ticks are infected with the bacteria when they feed on infected animals like birds and rodents, such as white-footed mice and chipmunks, it is likely the majority of the animals in areas where ticks were recovered also do not carry the bacteria.</p>&nbsp;

                        <h2>Recommendations for Prevention Efforts</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p class="mb-0">There is a high correlation between the number of ticks found during sampling and the number of ticks positive for <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>.</p>&nbsp;
                        <p class="mb-0">Education and prevention efforts should be focused on areas where the highest tick populations were found: near Rouge Park, Rouge Park: Glen Eagle Vista Trail and Colonel Danforth Trail. Primary recommended public health measures to prevent tick bites and tick-borne diseases rely on individual behaviors, including:
                            <ul>
                                <li>wearing protective clothing</li>
                                <li>the use of tick repellents on clothing and skin </li>
                                <li>taking a shower or bath after an activity in a risk area</li>
                                <li>regular tick checks, ie. the practice of a body examination to quickly detect and remove ticks on or attached to the skin. </li>
                                </ul>
                        </p>&nbsp;
                        <p class="mb-0">In areas where possible, education should be shared about the post exposure prophylactic (PEP) treatment of one dose of doxycycline after a bite, depending on certain criteria, to prevent infection with Lyme Disease. At the peri-domestic level, regular mowing of the lawn, collection of dead leaves and other measures aimed at reducing tick habitats near homes are also recommended.</p>&nbsp;
